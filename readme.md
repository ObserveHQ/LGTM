## 🔥 Why Busy Developers Love This

### The Observability Tax

```python
# Classic DIY Approach
time_spent = 40+ hours  # Initial setup
maintenance_overhead = 15% monthly  # Updates, scaling, integration
expertise_required = ['PromQL', 'LogQL', 'OTel', 'K8s']  # Hiring headaches

# Our Solution
your_time_investment = "1 Zoom call"  # Seriously
```
