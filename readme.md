## Why Your Application Needs the LGTM Stack

Modern applications are more complex than ever. The LGTM stack equips you with four essential tools to cut through that complexity:

- **Logging:**  
  Consolidate logs from every component of your application. Quickly search and analyze logs to diagnose issues and understand system behavior over time.

- **Graphing:**  
  Transform raw data into dynamic, easy-to-read visualizations. Spot trends, track performance metrics, and identify bottlenecks at a glance.

- **Tracing:**  
  Follow the path of individual requests through your distributed systems. Pinpoint where delays occur and uncover the root causes of performance issues.

- **Monitoring:**  
  Stay on top of your system’s health with real-time alerts and performance tracking. Proactively detect anomalies and prevent downtime before it impacts your users.

Together, these tools provide a comprehensive view of your application’s health, making it easier to optimize performance, enhance reliability, and scale with confidence.
